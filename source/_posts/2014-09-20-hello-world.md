As the first post, I’m glad to present to you my very first personal webpage.

The point in all this blogsite is about exposing my personal training as a programmer due to my adquired knowledge from reading, comparing, speaking with people or just by listening from profesionals on the matters.

But also, I’ll talk about my living experiences as a programmer. From writing down the code, going throught processes of planification, arquitecture and methodology to building up teamwork and controlling timings.
What I’ve found useful or not, what I’m pleased to remark and recommend and, in my humble opinion, what you should practice or not.

From here on we’ve got the perfect place to talk.
