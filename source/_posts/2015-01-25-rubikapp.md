RubikApp is an adapted game from the classic table game Rummikub but for Smart TVs and Smartphones.

The functionality is really simple. There are 52 pieces in total, 13 green, 13 red, 13 black and 13 blue. Each one has to do with a number from 1 to 13. As game starts 8 pieces are dealt to every player and the first player starts to play.

Talking about multiplaying, the game can be up to 4 players at the same time, players have their respective pieces shown in their phone App during the game run.

The point on the game is to throw all the pieces from your hand into the table before anybody else. To achieve this, during your turn, you have to try to make Straight Flush within your hand and pieces on the table.
The user can send 2 or more pieces, building Straight Flush or adding a single piece to complete Straight Flushes on the table.

As you can see to operate into the game is really simple in order to master as soon as posible.
But how exactely does it work? Let me show you a little step by step introduction.
First of all you have to start up you Smart TV application and also your mobile app.

Synchronizing screens will display in order to make the connection between smartphone and TV app. As you may realize is all about entering the pincode shown on the TV to your phone App, and so each player who wants to play.

Once all your devices are correctly connected, push your Enter button on your TV controller.
As you can see, each player has their first 8 pieces in their own phones. Meanwhile a table board is shown on the TV with the first piece displayed to be able to start the game.
Each user has 3 different actions during the turn:

- **SELECT**: Allows to select the pieces in order to prepare their delivery. If you select the piece, it will be included to the delivery, but if you do not want so, just click it again.

- **SEND**: Once you have selected the pieces to send, pushing the send button will analyze whether the pieces are correct choices or not. If it is, pieces will be sent to the table TV reordering the pieces displayed with the ones added. On the other hand, if the you were not able to select that/those pieces and the rest players are still waiting for you to try with another choice.

- **END TURN**: In the case the user does not have or just do not see a good chance on selecting cards, you can make your turn end and automaticaly draw a card.

Pieces are reorder automaticaly when players send the ones from their hands. Also you can see how the turn is being displayed as a square bordering the currently player.

As mentioned before, the game ends when one of the players has no cards left on his hand. Being automaticaly the winner.
