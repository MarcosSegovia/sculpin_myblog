It seems entrepreneur lifestyle always comes up with energy as times get worse to find a job. It is not by chance that we’re living an entrepreneur moment for any kind of people and company.

As you try to go deeper, It’s not difficult to find out people thoughts and lots of guidelines about ‘How to make your ideas posible’ or ‘Start building’.

There are lot of facts involved, as It is no longer two people coding from a garage. We are talking about incubators, accelerometers, risk investors, partnership, lot of networking and more.
But to make the long story short, I’ll speak about the last book I’ve got the pleasure to read: [The Lean Startup by Eric Ries][er].

I’ve mention a lot on twitter as I’ve got a sentence that summarize a main concept.
Here are some of them:

>- Without innovation there is not posible growth.
- Build by taking your customers the closest posible.
- Forget about huge plans, build your MVP (Minimum viable product) and fail, then sprint.
- If you don’t know who’s the customer, good quality neither.

Basically, this post-modern methodology, father of the agile methodologies nowadays, tries to chance our sight about planning and managing projects.
This method makes and effort on collaboration between different departments and the reconciliation with customers. It also recognize the fail as a good thing. And this is a completely change of mind. It is not about failing, it is about being able to stand up as fast as posible and iterate until the product success.
